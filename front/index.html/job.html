			<article><p class="prg">You can’t work in a vacuum, disconnected emotionally from colleagues. It’s not good for you or business. While flying solo may ace the occasional independent results and accolades, that’ll be fleeting. Sooner or later, says Taylor, we all come to rely on our colleagues and they come to rely on you, and when you sincerely pay it forward, you will get back more than you give. So reach out and touch someone – emotionally. Workplace wellness expert Beverly Beuerman-King is big believer in the power of social connections. “An Australian study reports those who had a large network of friends outlived those with the fewest friends by 22%. Companionship provided by friends may ward off depression, boost self-esteem, and provide support.” Add to that fewer cardiovascular problems and immune problems, and lower levels of cortisol – the perfect RX for good health.But don’t think you have to get along with everyone in the office to reap the benefits – that’s impossible. Not everyone is friend material and, face it, there are some annoying people at work. “There are times that you will need to assert your opinion that may be different from others. The key to getting along is to know how to communicate in a way that maintains the other person’s trust and dignity,” says Beuermann-King, of worksmartlivesmart.com. “So say what you mean, mean what you say, but don’t be mean when you say it.” <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-CV-(Curriculum-Vitae)"> our site </a> to build your CV </p> </article>

			<article><p class="prg">An office is generally a room or other area where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization. The word "office" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an adjective, the term "office" may refer to business-related tasks. In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair. An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions. As per James Stephenson, "Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities." <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-CV-(Curriculum-Vitae)"> our site </a> to build your CV </p> </article>
